Total number of courses included: 9500+

## Project Objective

The aim of this project is to provide students at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) with a convenient tool for quickly accessing course outlines. Currently, course registration information only includes course names and class times. While the UCAS course outline website is accessible, it lacks an effective navigation page.

## Project Background

Through detailed research on course outline URLs, we have exported the relationships between the website and the courses to create a navigation site for easy access to course outlines. This website was developed to help students obtain more comprehensive information when selecting courses, enabling them to make better-informed decisions.

## Usage Instructions

This website and its README have been entirely written using GPT technology to ensure clarity and accuracy. There may be some incomplete course information, and we will continuously update the site to provide the latest information.
